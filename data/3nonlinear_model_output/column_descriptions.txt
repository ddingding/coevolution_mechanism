yhat                    expected growth rate of the mutant by the nonlinear, independent model
t_mut                   toxin amino acid variant
at_mut                  antitoxin amino acid variant
yobs                    observed mutant growth rate
resid                   residual of the observed from the expected growth rate
oh_all                  one-hot encoding of this particular mutant
linear_latent           the linear latent expectation of this mutant (before being passed through the nonlinearity) in the nonlinear, independent model
ols                     linear, independent (ordinary least squares) regression expectation of the double mutant growth rate
yobs_from_wt            the observed double mutant growth rate different from the wild-type toxin antitoxin pair
linear_latent_from_wt   difference in the linear latent expectation of this mutant to the wild-type toxin antitoxin pair
yhat_from_wt            difference in the expected growth rate of this mutant from the wild-type toxin antitoxin pair
yobs_errors             the 95% posterior highest density interval of the observed growth rate as inferred by the bayesian inference
